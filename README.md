Demo drop-in scans for Solita crash course 2023-03-15

## Remarks

1. This repo is made **public** for the participants' access convenience.
2. Note that unless you have GHAS (GitHub Advanced Security), 
   public GitHub repos have **more** security options 
   available, compared to internal and private repos.
   In particular, without GHAS:
   - internal and private repos have no possibility to use CodeQL SAST;
   - you cannot upload .sarif files with security scan results to GitHub;
   - you have no credentials scans.
