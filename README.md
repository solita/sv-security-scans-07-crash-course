# sv-security-scans-07-crash-course

Demo drop-in scans for Solita crash course 2023-03-15

## Remarks

1. This repo is made **public** for the participants' access convenience.
2. Note that unless you have GHAS (GitHub Advanced Security), 
   public GitHub repos have **more** security options 
   available, compared to internal and private repos.
   In particular, without GHAS:
   - internal and private repos have no possibility to use CodeQL SAST;
   - you cannot upload .sarif files with security scan results to GitHub;
   - you have no credentials scans.


## Workflows in `.github/workflows/`

Uses the latest official Docker image from DockerHub for the
prominent credentials scan tool GitLeaks. Note that using 
an official GitHub action requires a license. Therefore, you are 
interested to adopt/adapt this workflow!
